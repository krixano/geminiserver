# April 30, 2021 - GitHub Proxy Improvements
I have worked a bit more on the GitHub Proxy:
* Finished off the file browser for the default branch, including detecting mime types by extension so the correct mimetype is sent, and adding custom support for .gpub and .gmi/.gemini files
* New page to list branches
* Reorganized the repo pages
