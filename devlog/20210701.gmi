# 2021-07-01 Search Engine & Ponix Capsule Now Open Source (MIT)

I have created a new simple Search Engine for Gemini. It is still a work in progress, but I have many things planned, including better search results and better performance (as searching is still quite slow).

=> /searchengine/ Search Engine Page

I have also Open Sourced *all* of this capsule (aside from server passwords and API Keys) as MIT.
