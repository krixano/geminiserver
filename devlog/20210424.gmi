# April 24, 2021 - YouTube Proxy Launch
I have been working a lot today on the YouTube interface. It is mostly complete, aside from being able to download videos. Downloading videos is turning out harder than I thought it would, but I have thoughts on some workarounds for it. Below is a list of things that have been implemented:

* Search
* Video Page
* Channel Page
* Playlist Page
* Channel Uploads
* Channel Playlists
* [new] Downloading of Videos is now complete (although, only downloads fairly low-quality atm)
