# Multics Pubnix Launch
I am launching a new pubnix of the Multics OS hosted on this server, called "Ponics"! If you want to join, send an email to:
=> mailto:krixano@mailbox.org krixano@mailbox.org

The system has local mail and a forum/BBS system. There is also various text editors, including emacs, qedx, TECO, and a few others. There are various programming languages, including Pascal, Lisp, C, PL/I, Fortran, and Basic. And there are powerful word processing and document creation tools.

You can find a list of tutorials, manuals, and a guide to get connected for the first time here:
