# April 27, 2021 - Odin Mirror Launch
I have created a mirror capsule for the Odin website (with permission from the creator). It is not perfect quite yet, so some things like images and the downloads and blog posts are missing. I will fix these things in the future. There is also issues with links inside lists.

P.S. I have also added an Atom feed for this devlog, for anyone who uses that over Gemini Subscriptions.
